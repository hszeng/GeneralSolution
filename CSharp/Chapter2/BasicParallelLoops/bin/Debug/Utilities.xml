            <summary>
            Multiplexer that serializes inputs from multiple producers into a single consumer enumeration in a 
            user-specified order. 
            </summary>
            <typeparam name="T">The type of input element</typeparam>
            <remarks>The use case for this class is a producer/consumer scenario with multiple producers and 
            a single consumer. The producers each have their private blocking collections for enqueuing the elements
            that they produce. The consumer of the producer queues is the multiplexer, which is responsible 
            combining the inputs from all of the producers according to user-provided "lock order." The multiplexer 
            provides an enumeration that a consumer can use to observe the multiplexed values in the chosen order. 
            
            The multiplexer does not perform sorting. Instead, it relies on the fact the the producer queues are
            locally ordered and looks for the next value by simultaneously monitoring the heads of 
            all of the producer queues.
            
            The order of elements in the producer queues is given by a user-provided lockOrderFn delegate. This is called
            lock order and is represented by an integer. The initial lock id is specified in the multiplexer's constructor. 
            Producer queues must be consistent. This means that they are locally ordered with respect to lock ids. When
            multiplexed together into a single enumeration, the producer queues must produce a sequence of values whose 
            lock ids are consecutive. (The lock ids in the individual producer queues must be in order but not necessarily 
            consecutive.)
            
            It is not required that all elements in the producer queues have a lock order. The position of such elements (denoted
            by a lock id that is less than zero) is constrained by preceding and succeeding elements in the producer's queue
            that do include a lock order. This results in a partial order. The unit tests for this class for an example of 
            partial ordering constraints.

            <remarks>This blocking collection for the use of the producer only. Its only consumer of the 
            is the multiplexer instance that created it.
            
            The producer should invoke Add to insert elements as needed. After the last element, the producer 
            invokes CompleteAdding.
            
            If the boundedCapacity was specified in the multiplexer's constructor, this value will be used as the
            boundedCapacity of the blocking collections used by the producers. This will cause the producer to block
            when trying to add elements to the blocking collection above this limit.
            
            There is a partial order constraint on the values added by the producer to this blocking collection. The 
            lockOrderFn that was provided to the constructor of the multiplexer will be applied to each element in 
            the queue by the multiplexer. If the lockOrderFn returns a non-negative value for the enqueued 
            object, this value must be strictly greater than the lock order of all previous objects that were added 
            to this blocking collection.
            
            All producer queues must be created before getting the consumer's enumerable object.</remarks>
